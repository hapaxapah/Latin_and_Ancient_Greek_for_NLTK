<p>
. . . Ahmose, called Pen-Nekhbet; he says: "By the sovereign, who lives forever! I was not separated from the king upon the battlefield, from (the time of) King Nebpehtire, triumphant, to King Okhepernere, triumphant; I was in favor of the king's presence, until King Menkheperre, living forever.
