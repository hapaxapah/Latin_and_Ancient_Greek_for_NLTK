Thucydides: The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War (432 B.C.)
</p>

<p class=border></P>

<p>
66. The Athenians and Peloponnesians had these antecedent grounds of complaint against each other: the complaint of <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/corinth.html">Corinth</A> was that her colony of <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/thucydnotes/potidaea.html">Potidaea</A>, and Corinthian and Peloponnesian citizens within it, were being besieged; that of <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/athens.html">Athens</A> against the Peloponnesians that they had incited a town of hers, a member of her alliance and a contributor to her revenue, to revolt, and had come and were openly fighting against her on the side of the Potidaeans.  For all this, war had not yet broken out: there was still truce for a while; for this was a private enterprise on the part of <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/corinth.html">Corinth</A>.
</p>

<p>
67. But the siege of <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/thucydnotes/potidaea.html">Potidaea</A> put an end to her inaction; she had men inside it: besides, she feared for the place.  Immediately summoning the allies to Lacedaemon, she came and loudly accused <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/athens.html">Athens</A> of breach of the treaty and aggression on the rights of Peloponnese.  With her, the <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/aegina.html">Aeginetans</A>, formally unrepresented from fear of <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/athens.html">Athens</A>, in secret proved not the least urgent of the advocates for war, asserting that they had not the independence guaranteed to them by the treaty. After extending the summons to any of their allies and others who might have complaints to make of Athenian aggression, the Lacedaemonians held their ordinary assembly, and invited them to speak.  There were many who came forward and made their several accusations; among them the <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/thucydnotes/megara.html">Megarians</A>, in a long list of grievances, called special attention to the fact of their exclusion from the ports of the Athenian empire and the market of <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/athens.html">Athens</A>, in defiance of the treaty.  Last of all the Corinthians came forward, and having let those who preceded them inflame the Lacedaemonians, now followed with a speech to this effect:
</p>

<p>
68. "Lacedaemonians! the confidence which you feel in your constitution and social order, inclines you to receive any reflections of ours on other powers with a certain scepticism.  Hence springs your moderation, but hence also the rather limited knowledge which you betray in dealing with foreign politics.  Time after time was our voice raised to warn you of the blows about to be dealt us by <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/athens.html">Athens</A>, and time after time, instead of taking the trouble to ascertain the worth of our communications, you contented yourselves with suspecting the speakers of being inspired by private interest.  And so, instead of calling these allies together before the blow fell, you have delayed to do so till we are smarting under it; allies among whom we have not the worst title to speak, as having the greatest complaints to make, complaints of Athenian outrage and Lacedaemonian neglect.  Now if these assaults on the rights of Hellas had been made in the dark, you might be unacquainted with the facts, and it would be our duty to enlighten you.  As it is, long speeches are not needed where you see servitude accomplished for some of us, meditated for others--in particular for our allies--and prolonged preparations in the aggressor against the hour of war.  Or what, pray, is the meaning of their reception of <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/thucydnotes/corcyra.html">Corcyra</A> by fraud, and their holding it against us by force? what of the siege of <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/thucydnotes/potidaea.html">Potidaea</A>?--places one of which lies most conveniently for any action against the Thracian towns; while the other would have contributed a very large navy to the Peloponnesians?
</p>

<p>
69. "For all this you are responsible.  You it was who first allowed them to fortify their city after the Median war, and afterwards to erect the long walls--you who, then and now, are always depriving of freedom not only those whom they have enslaved, but also those who have as yet been your allies.  For the true author of the subjugation of a people is not so much the immediate agent, as the power which permits it having the means to prevent it; particularly if that power aspires to the glory of being the liberator of Hellas.  We are at last assembled.  It has not been easy to assemble, nor even now are our objects defined.  We ought not to be still inquiring into the fact of our wrongs, but into the means of our defence.  For the aggressors with matured plans to oppose to our indecision have cast threats aside and betaken themselves to action.  And we know what are the paths by which Athenian aggression travels, and how insidious is its progress.  A degree of confidence she may feel from the idea that your bluntness of perception prevents your noticing her; but it is nothing to the impulse which her advance will receive from the knowledge that you see, but do not care to interfere.  You, Lacedaemonians, of all the Hellenes are alone inactive, and defend yourselves not by doing anything but by looking as if you would do something; you alone wait till the power of an enemy is becoming twice its original size, instead of crushing it in its infancy.  And yet the world used to say that you were to be depended upon; but in your case, we fear, it said more than the truth.  The Mede, we ourselves know, had time to come from the ends of the earth to Peloponnese, without any force of yours worthy of the name advancing to meet him. But this was a distant enemy.  Well, <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/athens.html">Athens</A> at all events is a near neighbour, and yet <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/athens.html">Athens</A> you utterly disregard; against <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/athens.html">Athens</A> you prefer to act on the defensive instead of on the offensive, and to make it an affair of chances by deferring the struggle till she has grown far stronger than at first.  And yet you know that on the whole the rock on which the barbarian was wrecked was himself, and that if our present enemy <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/athens.html">Athens</A> has not again and again annihilated us, we owe it more to her blunders than to your protection; Indeed, expectations from you have before now been the ruin of some, whose faith induced them to omit preparation.
</p>

<p>
"We hope that none of you will consider these words of remonstrance to be rather words of hostility; men remonstrate with friends who are in error, accusations they reserve for enemies who have wronged them.  
</p>

<p>
70. "Besides, we consider that we have as good a right as any one to point out a neighbour's faults, particularly when we contemplate the great contrast between the two national characters; a contrast of which, as far as we can see, you have little perception, having never yet considered what sort of antagonists you will encounter in the Athenians, how widely, how absolutely different from yourselves.  The Athenians are addicted to innovation, and their designs are characterized by swiftness alike in conception and execution; you have a genius for keeping what you have got, accompanied by a total want of invention, and when forced to act you never go far enough.  Again, they are adventurous beyond their power, and daring beyond their judgment, and in danger they are sanguine; your wont is to attempt less than is justified by your power, to mistrust even what is sanctioned by your judgment, and to fancy that from danger there is no release.  Further, there is promptitude on their side against procrastination on yours; they are never at home, you are never from it: for they hope by their absence to extend their acquisitions, you fear by your advance to endanger what you have left behind.  They are swift to follow up a success, and slow to recoil from a reverse.  Their bodies they spend ungrudgingly in their country's cause; their intellect they jealously husband to be employed in her service.  A scheme unexecuted is with them a positive loss, a successful enterprise a comparative failure.  The deficiency created by the miscarriage of an undertaking is soon filled up by fresh hopes; for they alone are enabled to call a thing hoped for a thing got, by the speed with which they act upon their resolutions.  Thus they toil on in trouble and danger all the days of their life, with little opportunity for enjoying, being ever engaged in getting: their only idea of a holiday is to do what the occasion demands, and to them laborious occupation is less of a misfortune than the peace of a quiet life.  To describe their character in a word, one might truly say that they were born into the world to take no rest themselves and to give none to others.
</p>

<p>
71. "Such is <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/athens.html">Athens</A>, your antagonist.  And yet, Lacedaemonians, you still delay, and fail to see that peace stays longest with those, who are not more careful to use their power justly than to show their determination not to submit to injustice.  On the contrary, your ideal of fair dealing is based on the principle that, if you do not injure others, you need not risk your own fortunes in preventing others from injuring you.  Now you could scarcely have succeeded in such a policy even with a neighbour like yourselves; but in the present instance, as we have just shown, your habits are old-fashioned as compared with theirs.  It is the law as in art, so in politics, that improvements ever prevail; and though fixed usages may be best for undisturbed communities, constant necessities of action must be accompanied by the constant improvement of methods.  Thus it happens that the vast experience of <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/athens.html">Athens</A> has carried her further than you on the path of innovation.
</p>

<p>
"Here, at least, let your procrastination end.  For the present, assist your allies and <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/thucydnotes/potidaea.html">Potidaea</A> in particular, as you promised, by a speedy invasion of <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/notes/attica.html">Attica</A>, and do not sacrifice friends and kindred to their bitterest enemies, and drive the rest of us in despair to some other alliance.  Such a step would not be condemned either by the Gods who received our oaths, or by the men who witnessed them.  The breach of a treaty cannot be laid to the people whom desertion compels to seek new relations, but to the power that fails to assist its confederate.  But if you will only act, we will stand by you; it would be unnatural for us to change, and never should we meet with such a congenial ally.  For these reasons choose the right course, and endeavour not to let Peloponnese under your supremacy degenerate from the prestige that it enjoyed under that of your ancestors."
</p>

<p>
72. Such were the words of the Corinthians.  There happened to be Athenian envoys present at Lacedaemon on other business.  On hearing the speeches they thought themselves called upon to come before the Lacedaemonians.  Their intention was not to offer a defence on any of the charges which the cities brought against them, but to show on a comprehensive view that it was not a matter to be hastily decided on, but one that demanded further consideration.  There was also a wish to call attention to the great power of <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/athens.html">Athens</A>, and to refresh the memory of the old and enlighten the ignorance of the young, from a notion that their words might have the effect of inducing them to prefer tranquillity to war.  So they came to the Lacedaemonians and said that they too, if there was no objection, wished to speak to their assembly.  They replied by inviting them to come forward.  The Athenians advanced, and spoke as follows:
</p>

<p>
73. "The object of our mission here was not to argue with your allies, but to attend to the matters on which our state dispatched us. However, the vehemence of the outcry that we hear against us has prevailed on us to come forward.  It is not to combat the accusations of the cities (indeed you are not the judges before whom either we or they can plead), but to prevent your taking the wrong course on matters of great importance by yielding too readily to the persuasions of your allies.  We also wish to show on a review of the whole indictment that we have a fair title to our possessions, and that our country has claims to consideration.  We need not refer to remote antiquity: there we could appeal to the voice of tradition, but not to the experience of our audience.  But to the Median War and contemporary history we must refer, although we are rather tired of continually bringing this subject forward.  In our action during that war we ran great risk to obtain certain advantages: you had your share in the solid results, do not try to rob us of all share in the good that the glory may do us.  However, the story shall be told not so much to deprecate hostility as to testify against it, and to show, if you are so ill advised as to enter into a struggle with <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/athens.html">Athens</A>, what sort of an antagonist she is likely to prove.  We assert that at <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/marathon.html">Marathon</A> we were at the front, and faced the barbarian single-handed.  That when he came the second time, unable to cope with him by land we went on board our ships with all our people, and joined in the action at <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/salamis.html">Salamis.</A>  This prevented his taking the Peloponnesian states in detail, and ravaging them with his fleet; when the multitude of his vessels would have made any combination for self-defence impossible.  The best proof of this was furnished by the invader himself.  Defeated at sea, he considered his power to be no longer what it had been, and retired as speedily as possible with the greater part of his army.
</p>

<p>
74. "Such, then, was the result of the matter, and it was clearly proved that it was on the fleet of Hellas that her cause depended.  Well, to this result we contributed three very useful elements, viz., the largest number of ships, the ablest commander, and the most unhesitating patriotism.  Our contingent of ships was little less than two-thirds of the whole four hundred; the commander was <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herodnotes/themistocles.html">Themistocles</A>, through whom chiefly it was that the battle took place in the straits, the acknowledged salvation of our cause.  Indeed, this was the reason of your receiving him with honours such as had never been accorded to any foreign visitor.  While for daring patriotism we had no competitors.  Receiving no reinforcements from behind, seeing everything in front of us already subjugated, we had the spirit, after abandoning our city, after sacrificing our property (instead of deserting the remainder of the league or depriving them of our services by dispersing), to throw ourselves into our ships and meet the danger, without a thought of resenting your neglect to assist us.  We assert, therefore, that we conferred on you quite as much as we received.  For you had a stake to fight for; the cities which you had left were still filled with your homes, and you had the prospect of enjoying them again; and your coming was prompted quite as much by fear for yourselves as for us; at all events, you never appeared till we had nothing left to lose.  But we left behind us a city that was a city no longer, and staked our lives for a city that had an existence only in desperate hope, and so bore our full share in your deliverance and in ours.  But if we had copied others, and allowed fears for our territory to make us give in our adhesion to the Mede before you came, or if we had suffered our ruin to break our spirit and prevent us embarking in our ships, your naval inferiority would have made a sea-fight unnecessary, and his objects would have been peaceably attained.
</p>

<p>
75. "Surely, Lacedaemonians, neither by the patriotism we displayed in [the Persian Wars], nor by the wisdom of our counsels, do we merit our extreme unpopularity with the Hellenes, not at least unpopularity for our empire.
</P>
<p>
 "That empire, which we acquired by no violent means, because you were unwilling to continue the war against the Persians and because the allies attached themselves to us and spontaneously asked us to assume the command. And the nature of the case first compelled us to advance our empire to its present height; fear being our principal motive, though honor and self-interest came in afterwards. And at last, when almost all hated us, when some had already revolted and had been subdued, when you had ceased to be the friends that you once were, and had become objects of suspicion and dislike, it appeared no longer safe to give up our empire; especially as all who left us would fall to you. And no one can quarrel with a people for making, in matters of tremendous risk, the best provision that it can for its self-interest.
</P>
<p>
76. "It was in keeping with the practice of mankind for us to accept an empire that was offered to us, and if we refused to give it up under the pressure of three of the strongest motives, fear, honor, and self-interest. And it is not we who set the example, for it has always been the law that the weaker should be subject to the stronger. Besides, we believed ourselves to be worthy of our position, and so you thought until now, when calculations of interest have made you take up the cry of justice &#151; a consideration that no one has ever yet brought forward to hinder his ambition when he had a chance of gaining anything by might. And praise is due to all who, if not so superior to human nature as to refuse dominion, yet respect justice more than their position compels them to do.
</P>
<p>
77. "We imagine that our moderation would be best demonstrated by the conduct of others who should be placed in our position; but even our equity has very unreasonably subjected us to condemnation instead of approval. Our abatement of our rights in the contract trials with our allies, and our causing them to be decided by impartial laws at Athens, have gained us the character of being litigious. And none care to inquire why this reproach is not brought against other imperial powers, who treat their subjects with less moderation than we do; the secret being that where force can be used, law is not needed. But our subjects are so habituated to associate with us as equals, that any defeat whatever that clashes with their notions of justice, whether it proceeds from a legal judgment or from the power which our empire gives us, makes them forget to be grateful for being allowed to retain most of their possessions, and more vexed at a part being taken, than if we had from the first cast law aside and openly gratified our covetousness."
