Aelius Aristeides: To Rome (A.D. 143)
</p>

<p class=border></P>

<p>
Far more worthy of examination and wonder than all else is your citizenship and the magnificence of its concept, for there is nothing like it anywhere.</P>
<p>
Having divided into two groups all peoples in your empire &#151; having used this word, I mean to say the whole inhabited world &#151; you have defined the more accomplished, the more high-minded, and the more powerful civic body, or (one might say) everything that is of the same breed as yourself, while the rest of the empire is a mere subject under your rule.
</P>
<p>
The sea is not a hindrance to becoming a citizen, nor is the mass of the intervening land, nor is any distinction made here between Asia and Europe.  Everything lies within reach of everyone.  Nobody is a stranger who is worthy of magistracy or trust, but a free republic in which the whole world shares, has been established under one excellent ruler and director, and everyone meets as if in a common assembly, each to receive his just reward.</P>
