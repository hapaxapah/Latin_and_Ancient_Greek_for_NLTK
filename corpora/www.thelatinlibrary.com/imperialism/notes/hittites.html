<p class=subpagehead>The Hittites
</p>

<p class=border></p>

<p>
<p>Four thousand years ago the warrior Hittites of Asia Minor rose to world power. For more than a thousand years they ruled most of the region now in modern Turkey and Syria. Their empire rivaled in size and strength the two other world powers of the time, Egypt and the Assyro-Babylonian empires of Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>About a thousand years before the Christian Era their empire fell and their civilization passed into oblivion. Only their name remained, kept in man's memory by scattered references in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>
The story of the Hittites, nearly all that is known of it, has been recovered within a single lifetime. Most of it has been pieced together since World War I. The chief source of information is the royal library of 10,000 clay tablets discovered in 1906 and later, in the ruins of the ancient Hittite capital Khattushash, near Bogaz Koi in Turkey, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) east of Ankara.</p>

<p>These tablets are in cuneiform writing, and most of them, though in Babylonian spelling, are in the Hittite language. For years Hugo Winckler, the German archaeologist who made the find, and other scholars labored vainly to get a clue to this unknown tongue. One day an Austrian professor, Friedrich Hrozny, found in the same sentence with the Babylonian word-sign for bread, the Hittite word wadar spelled out. He thought this might be the same as our "water." Other words seemed to have the same roots as the Latin "aqua" (water) and our "eat." Working from these slight clues, by 1915 he was able to announce that he had solved the riddle, and that Hittite is an Indo-European language, related to our own. But the translation of the tablets took another ten years.

<p>From these and other documents, and from the remains of their great fortified cities, it is now known that the Hittites were wild tribesmen when, not long after 3000 BC, they swept down from the north with horse and chariot and bronze daggers. They found it easy to conquer the farmers and herdsmen of Asia Minor, who were skilled only in the arts of peace and had no means of transport faster or more powerful than the donkey. It was almost 2000 BC, however, before the Hittite dominions were united into an empire by a king named Labarna. A later king pushed the Hittite power into Syria and Mesopotamia. This empire lasted until 1650 BC. A still more powerful one arose in 1450 BC. </p>

The Hittites appear to have been the first to use iron. For a time their mines on the Black Sea represented the world supply.</p>

<p>Later the Hittite domain broke up into city kingdoms (1050-850 BC), and these finally collapsed before the Acheans, who came in a new wave of Indo-European invasion like that from which the Hittite empire had sprung. The Hittites continued to be famous soldiers, however. Uriah the Hittite was a captain in David's army.</p>

<p>In the fertile fringes of their rugged country the ancient Hittites planted barley, wheat, grapes, and olives. Beekeeping was their sugar industry. They raised horses, cattle, sheep, and goats. Their shoes, turned up like a ski, were invented for use in snowy mountain passes. Loom weights and spindle whorls found in great numbers show that they manufactured cloth. Beautiful cups, jars, and pitchers indicate their interest in graceful and original forms and in convenient contrivances. The Hittites were also famous workers in metals. Their business methods were Babylonian, and for buying and selling they too used the weighed pieces of silver from which the Greeks got the idea for coins. Caravan routes led from town to town. Big game abounded, and hunting was the sport of king and commoner.</p>

<p>The Hittite state was a military organization. Daily life was closely regulated by law. The price of plowed field and vineyard, of cattle and their hides, was fixed. So were the wages of free man and slave. Punishments for breaches of the law were mild, but crimes such as murder and theft were made prohibitively expensive by heavy fines.
<p>The Hittites contributed to Western civilization by acting as middlemen for the older cultures of the East. They passed on to the Greeks ideas that influenced their art, their religion, and their business. Hittite mines supplied the iron that put new implements in the hands of the Mediterranean peoples and brought the Bronze Age to a close. Above all, Hittites contributed by holding with a firm hand the bridge between Asia and Europe while Western culture was in its early stages. Asian despots might have throttled European civilization in its infancy, had it not been for that millennium of Hittite supremacy. (Student Encyclopaedia Britannica Article)</p>
