<p class=subpagehead>Peloponnesian League
</p>

<P class=border></P>

<P>Military coalition of Greek city-states led by Sparta, formed in the 6th century BC. League policy, usually decisions on questions of war, peace, or alliance, was determined by federal congresses, summoned by the Spartans when they thought fit; each member state had one vote. The league was a major force in Greek affairs, forming the nucleus of resistance to the Persian invasions (480-479) and fighting against Athens in the Peloponnesian War (431-404). Spartan power declined after the defeat at Leuctra (371), and the league disintegrated in 366-365 BC. (Encyclopaedia Britannica Article)</P>
