<p class=subpagehead>Matthew C. Perry (1794-1858)
</p>

<P class=border></P>

U.S. naval officer who headed an expedition that forced Japan in 1853-54 to enter into trade and diplomatic relations with the West after more than two centuries of isolation. Through his efforts the United States became an equal power with Britain, France, and Russia in the economic exploitation of East Asia.

Earlier, Perry had served as commanding officer (1837-40) of the first U.S. steamship, the "Fulton"; led a naval squadron to Africa to help suppress the slave trade (1843); and successfully commanded naval forces during the Mexican War (1846-48). In March 1852 Pres. Millard Fillmore placed Perry&#151;who was called by his honorary rank of commodore&#151;in charge of a naval expedition to induce the Japanese government to establish diplomatic relations with the United States. After studying the situation, Perry concluded that Japan's traditional policy of isolation would be altered only if superior naval forces were displayed and if Japanese officials were approached with a "resolute attitude." <IMG SRC="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/imperialism/images/perry.jpg" WIDTH="246" HEIGHT="362" BORDER="0" HSPACE=30 VSPACE=30 ALIGN=RIGHT> With two frigates and two sailing vessels, he entered the fortified harbour of Uraga on July 8, 1853&#151;an act widely publicized throughout the world. Calling himself an "admiral," he refused to obey Japanese orders to leave and sent word that if the government did not delegate a suitable person to receive the documents in his possession, he would deliver them by force if necessary. The Japanese defenses were inadequate to resist him, and after a few days of diplomatic sparring they accepted his letter from the President of the United States requesting a treaty.

In the interim, the Japanese, who were aware of China's recent defeat by the technologically superior Western powers in the Opium War (1839-42), decided to agree to Perry's terms as a way of stalling for time while they improved their defenses. In February 1854 he reappeared in Edo (modern Tokyo) Bay&#151;this time with nine ships&#151;and on March 31 concluded the first treaty between the two countries. The pact assured better treatment of shipwrecked seamen, permitted U.S. ships to obtain fuel and supplies at two minor ports, arranged for a U.S. consul to reside at Shimoda, and opened the way for further U.S. trading privileges. Perry's success demonstrated the inability of the Shogun, Japan's hereditary military dictator, to enforce his country's traditional isolationist policy; the Japanese were soon forced to sign similar treaties with other Western nations. These events contributed to the collapse of the shogunate and ultimately to the modernization of Japan.

Considered thereafter an authority on the Far East, Perry stressed the danger of British and Russian expansion and urged a more active U.S. role in the Orient. He specifically recommended the acquisition of island bases in the Pacific to assure U.S. military and commercial superiority in the area, but the government was not ready to act on these proposals for roughly half a century.
