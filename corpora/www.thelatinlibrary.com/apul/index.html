<p class=subpagehead>Apuleius, Cupido et Psyche</p>

<p class=border></p>

<p> <b>Course Expectations and Objectives</b> </p>

<p> We will read Apuleius' <a
href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/apuleius/apuleius.cupid.shtml"><i>Cupido
et Psyche</I></a>, focusing closely on the grammar, vocabulary, and style
of the text, with significant comment on the historical and cultural
background. The student is expected to have mastered a basic second year
vocabulary and to be prepared to absorb a <i>considerable</i> quantity of new
vocabulary. Complete familiarity with basic forms (declension patterns,
pronouns, verb tenses, infinitives, participles, and gerundives) is
required.</p>

<p>Time permitting, we may read a few other tales (particularly the salacious and hilariously funny Tale of the Tub).
</P>

<p> Apuleius' style is generally straightforward, although his
vocabulary is diverse, with many ante- and post-classical words (and
more than a few which he likely coined himself). His fluidity matches
Livy and, although he is capable of complex periodic structure, he is equally
fond of complex ablative constructions. As with all
authors, Apuleius' style will become easier as you progress through the
text. </p>

<p> Students are expected to have prepared the assigned text well enough
to read it with minimal difficulty and discuss grammatical
constructions. </p>

<p> <b>Grammar Resources</b> </p>

<p> A systematic grammar of Latin is recommended.  Bennett's <i><a
href="http://www.bolchazy.com/prod.php?cat=latin&id=2611">New Latin
Grammar</a></i> or, better, Allen and Greenough's <a
href="http://focusbookstore.com/allenandgreenoughpb.aspx">New
Latin Grammar</a>.  Both are available for on-line purchase. Handouts on
basic grammar and vocabulary are available at the <a
href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/101/">Latin Handout Page</a>. </p>

<p> A good Latin dictionary is suggested. The complete Lewis & Short is
now on-line at the <a
href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.04.0059">Perseus</a> site. It is also available as an invaluable application for your iPad or
iPhone. </p>

<p> Do not hesitate to make use of a modern translation if needed to
comprehend fully the grammar of the Latin. Remember that English
translations are not grammatically faithful to the original. The Loeb
edition (found often at Borders) has a facing English translation, which
may be useful for those tackling Silver Age Latin for the first time. </p>

<p> <b>Quizzes and Examinations</b> </p>

<p> There will be regular vocabulary quizzes, with the cumulative grade
counting as an exam. </p>

<p> There will be 4 exams. Detailed information on what is expected on the examinations will be
provided. </p>
