<p class=subpagehead>Gaius Mucius Scaevola (c. 510 B.C.)
</p>

<P class=border></P>

<p>
Legendary Roman hero who is said to have saved Rome (c. 509 B.C.) from conquest by the Etruscan king Lars Porsena. According to the legend, Mucius volunteered to assassinate Porsena, who was besieging Rome, but killed his victim's attendant by mistake. Brought before the Etruscan royal tribunal, he declared that he was one of 300 noble youths who had sworn to take the king's life. He demonstrated his courage to his captors by thrusting his right hand into a blazing altar fire and holding it there until it was consumed. Deeply impressed and fearing another attempt on his life, Porsena ordered Mucius to be freed; he made peace with the Romans and withdrew his forces.

According to the story, Mucius was rewarded with a grant of land beyond the Tiber and given the name Scaevola, meaning "left-handed." The tale is presumably an attempt to explain the origin of Rome's famed Scaevola family. (Encyclopaedia Britannica Article)
