<p class=subpagehead>Leonidas (d. 480 B.C.)
</p>

<P class=border></P>

<P>
Spartan king whose stand against the invading Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae in central Greece is one of the enduring tales of Greek heroism, invoked throughout Western history as the epitome of bravery exhibited against overwhelming odds.<IMG SRC="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/imperialism/images/leonidas.jpg" WIDTH="92" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0" HSPACE=30 VSPACE=30 ALIGN=RIGHT>

<P>
A member of the Agiad house, Leonidas succeeded his half brother, Cleomenes I, as king, probably in 490. He was married to Cleomenes' daughter, Gorgo, and may have supported Cleomenes' aggressions against other Greek cities.

<P>In 480 Leonidas commanded the small Greek force that resisted the advance through Thermopylae of the vast army of the Persian king Xerxes. For two days Leonidas withstood Persian attacks; he then ordered most of his troops to retreat, and he and his 300-member royal guard fought to the last man. This episode made a deep impression on the Greek imagination and gave rise to the legend that Spartans never surrendered.  (Encyclopaedia Britannica Article)
