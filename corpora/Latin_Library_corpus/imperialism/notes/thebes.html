At one time the "seven-gated city of Thebes" was the seat of one of the oldest and greatest powers of Greece. Only a few ruins of the city remain today on the Cadmea, the acropolis, or citadel, of ancient Thebes. It was named for Cadmus, the mythical founder of the city. Thebes&#151;called Th&iacute;vai in modern Greek&#151;lies northwest of Athens in the central part of Boeotia in eastern Greece. This is a region of fertile and well-watered soil but heavy, fog-laden atmosphere. The Boeotians were said by their Athenian neighbors to be as dull as their native air. Nevertheless they produced such writers as the poet Pindar and the biographer Plutarch. Many warriors who achieved great glory in battle also came from this city.

When rivalry between Athens and Sparta finally resulted in the Peloponnesian War, from 431 to 404 BC, Thebes sided with Sparta. After the war ended, however, Thebes became Sparta's bitter foe because of the tyrannical policies of its former ally. After many conflicts the Thebans expelled the garrison placed by the treacherous Spartans in the Cadmea. They killed the leaders of the pro-Spartan party and formed a combination of Greek states against Sparta. The Spartans met military reverses and soon signed a peace with all their foes except Thebes, which was left unaided to bear the onslaught of the Spartan phalanx. This Spartan tactical device consisted of arranging the heavy-armed infantry in a solid mass 8 or 12 men deep. They advanced together so that the onrush flowed unbroken through the hostile lines.

The Theban commander Epaminondas was perhaps the most famous Greek of his day. He devised an effective answer to the phalanx. He used it when he met the foe in 371 BC on the plain of Leuctra, near Thebes.

<P>
Epaminondas arrayed his best troops on the left, 50 shields deep. This was directly opposite the right wing of the Spartans, where they had massed, as usual, their heaviest force, 12 deep. His shallower and weaker center and right wings he kept drawn up so that each line was to the right and rear of the preceding one. He held them in reserve while the massive Theban left drove against the Spartan right and crushed it. Then the Theban center and right coming into action completed the rout.

For nine years Thebes held supremacy over all Greece, but its power collapsed with the death of Epaminondas at the battle of Mantinea in 362 BC. When Philip of Macedon invaded Greece a few years later, Thebes joined forces with Athens, influenced by the eloquence of the orator Demosthenes. The Thebans made a brave but unsuccessful stand in the decisive battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, bearing the brunt of the attack. When Alexander the Great came to the Macedonian throne, Thebes attempted to recover its liberty. It was leveled to the ground in punishment. Although later rebuilt, it never again was an important city. Population (1991 census), 19,505. (Encyclopaedia Britannica)
