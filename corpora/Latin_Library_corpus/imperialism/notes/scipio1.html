<P class=border></P>

<P>
The Roman general Publius Cornelius Scipio earned his nickname Africanus by defeating Hannibal, Carthage's best general, at the battle of Zama in 202 B.C. By his tactical reforms and understanding of strategy, he created a Roman army that gave Rome the dominant position in Spain, North Africa, and Greece. His influence lived for centuries. During the Renaissance the poet Petrarch glorified him in a Latin epic entitled 'Africa'.</P>
<P>Scipio was born in Rome in 236 B.C. to one of the city's leading families. Of his boyhood little is known. He served in the army at Rome's disastrous defeat in the battle of Cannae in the Second Punic War. In 210 he accepted the generalship of the army in Spain. In 209 he conquered New Carthage (Cartagena). By 206 he had defeated all the armies of Carthage in Spain and given Rome control of the province. Next he set out to defeat Carthage's home base in Africa. He landed there with about 35,000 men in 204. By 202, with the great battle of Zama, Scipio had defeated Carthage completely.</P>
<P>With his military successes behind him, Scipio returned to Rome. He became leader of the Senate in 199. He also served as Roman emissary to Africa and in the East. His influence kept Greece firmly attached to Rome, and he strongly supported the emergence of Greek culture in Italy. Attacks by his enemies because of his leniency toward Carthage and Greece led him to abandon Rome for Liternum around 184. Embittered and ill, he died there soon afterward. His career had established Rome as a Mediterranean power. (Encyclopaedia Britannica Article)</P>
