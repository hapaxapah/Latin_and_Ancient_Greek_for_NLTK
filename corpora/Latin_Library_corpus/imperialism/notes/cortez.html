<p class=subpagehead>Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s (1485-1547)
</p>

<p class=border></P>

<p>
Cort&eacute;s also spelled  Cort&eacute;z  Spanish conquistador who overthrew the Aztec empire (1519­21) and won Mexico for the crown of Spain.
</p>

<p>
Cort&eacute;s was the son of Martín Cort&eacute;s de Monroy and of Doña Catalina Pizarro Altamarino&#151;names of ancient lineage. "They had little wealth, but much honour," according to Cort&eacute;s's secretary, Francisco L&oacute;pez de G&oacute;mara, who tells how, at age 14, the young Hern&aacute;n was sent to study at Salamanca, in west-central Spain, "because he was very intelligent and clever in everything he did." G&oacute;mara went on to describe him as ruthless, haughty, mischievous, and quarrelsome, "a source of trouble to his parents." Certainly he was "much given to women," frustrated by provincial life, and excited by stories of the Indies Columbus had just discovered. He set out for the east coast port of Valencia with the idea of serving in the Italian wars, but instead he "wandered idly about for nearly a year." Clearly Spain's southern ports, with ships coming in full of the wealth and colour of the Indies, proved a greater attraction. He finally sailed for the island of Hispaniola (now Santo Domingo) in 1504. He was then 19.
</p>

<p>
<b>Years in Hispaniola and Cuba</B>
</p>

<p>
In Hispaniola he became a farmer and notary to a town council; for the first six years or so, he seems to have been content to establish his position. He contracted syphilis and, as a result, missed the ill-fated expeditions of Diego de Nicuesa and Alonso de Ojeda, which sailed for the South American mainland in 1509. By 1511 he had recovered, and he sailed with Diego Vel&aacute;zquez to conquer Cuba. There Vel&aacute;zquez was appointed governor, and Cort&eacute;s clerk to the treasurer. Cort&eacute;s received a repartimiento (gift of land and Indian slaves) and the first house in the new capital of Santiago. He was now in a position of some power and the man to whom dissident elements in the colony began to turn for leadership.
</p>

<p>
Cort&eacute;s was twice elected alcalde ("mayor") of the town of Santiago and was a man who "in all he did, in his presence, bearing, conversation, manner of eating and of dressing, gave signs of being a great lord." It was therefore to Cort&eacute;s that Vel&aacute;zquez turned when, after news had come of the progress of Juan de Grijalba's efforts to establish a colony on the mainland, it was decided to send him help. An agreement appointing Cort&eacute;s captain general of a new expedition was signed in October 1518. Experience of the rough-and-tumble of New World politics advised Cort&eacute;s to move fast, before Vel&aacute;zquez changed his mind. His sense of the dramatic, his long experience as an administrator, the knowledge gained from so many failed expeditions, above all his ability as a speaker gathered to him six ships and 300 men, all in less than a month. The reaction of Vel&aacute;zquez was predictable; his jealousy aroused, he resolved to place leadership of the expedition in other hands. Cort&eacute;s, however, put hastily to sea to raise more men and ships in other Cuban ports.
</p>

<p>
<b>The expedition to Mexico</B>
</p>

<p>
When Cort&eacute;s finally sailed for the coast of Yucat&aacute;n on February 18, 1519, he had 11 ships, 508 soldiers, about 100 sailors, and&#151;most important&#151;16 horses. In March 1519 he landed at Tabasco, where he stayed for a time in order to gain intelligence from the local Indians. He won them over and received presents from them, including 20 women, one of whom, Marina ("Malinche"), became his mistress and interpreter and bore him a son, Martín. Cort&eacute;s sailed to another spot on the southeastern Mexican coast and founded Veracruz, mainly to have himself elected captain general and chief justice by his soldiers as citizens, thus shaking off the authority of Vel&aacute;zquez. On the mainland Cort&eacute;s did what no other expedition leader had done: he exercised and disciplined his army, welding it into a cohesive force. But the ultimate expression of his determination to deal with disaffection occurred when he burned his ships. By that single action he committed himself and his entire force to survival by conquest.
</p>

<p>
Cort&eacute;s then set out for the Mexican interior, relying sometimes on force, sometimes on amity toward the local Indian peoples, but always careful to keep conflict with them to a strict minimum. The key to Cort&eacute;s's subsequent conquests lay in the political crisis within the Aztec empire; the Aztecs were bitterly resented by many of the subject peoples who had to pay tribute to them. The ability of Cort&eacute;s as a leader is nowhere more apparent than in his quick grasp of the situation&#151;a grasp that was ultimately to give him more than 200,000 Indian allies. The nation of Tlaxcala, for instance, which was in a state of chronic war with Montezuma, ruler of the Aztec empire of Mexico, resisted Cort&eacute;s at first but when defeated became his most faithful ally. Rejecting all of Montezuma's threats and blandishments to keep him away from Tenochtitl&aacute;n or Mexico, the capital (rebuilt as Mexico City after 1521), Cort&eacute;s entered the city on November 8, 1519, with his small Spanish force and only 1,000 Tlaxcaltecs. Montezuma, believing him to incarnate the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl, received him with great honour. Cort&eacute;s soon decided to seize Montezuma in order to hold the country through its monarch and achieve not only its political conquest but its religious conversion. Marina worked on the complicated, enigmatic mind of Montezuma so subtly that he finally became the voluntary prisoner of her master. With this stroke Cort&eacute;s became the master of Tenochtitl&aacute;n.
</p>

<p>
Spanish politics and envy, however, were to bedevil Cort&eacute;s throughout his meteoric career. Cort&eacute;s soon heard of the arrival of a Spanish force from Cuba, led by P&aacute;nfilo Narv&aacute;ez, to deprive Cort&eacute;s of his command at a time (mid-1520) when he was holding the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl&aacute;n by little more than the force of his personality. Leaving a garrison in Tenochtitl&aacute;n of 80 Spaniards and a few hundred Tlaxcaltecs commanded by his most reckless captain, Pedro de Alvarado, Cort&eacute;s marched against Narv&aacute;ez, defeated him, and enlisted his army in his own forces. On his return, he found the Spanish garrison in Tenochtitl&aacute;n besieged by the Aztecs after Alvarado had massacred many leading Aztec chiefs during a festival. Hard pressed and lacking food, Cort&eacute;s decided to leave the city by night. The Spaniards' retreat from the capital was performed, but with a heavy loss in lives and most of the treasure they had accumulated. After six days of retreat Cort&eacute;s won the battle of Otumba over the Aztecs sent in pursuit (July 7, 1520).
</p>

<p>
Cort&eacute;s eventually rejoined his Tlaxcalan allies and reorganized his forces before again marching on Tenochtitl&aacute;n in December 1520. After subduing the neighbouring territories he laid siege to the city itself, conquering it street by street until its capture was completed on August 13, 1521. This victory marked the fall of the Aztec empire. Cort&eacute;s had become the absolute ruler of a huge territory extending from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, Vel&aacute;zquez was mounting an insidious political attack on Cort&eacute;s in Spain through Bishop Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca and the Council of the Indies. Fully conscious of the vulnerability of a successful conqueror whose field of operations was 5,000 miles (8,000 km) from the centre of political power, Cort&eacute;s countered with lengthy and detailed dispatches&#151;five remarkable letters to the Spanish king Charles V. His acceptance by the Indians and even his popularity as a relatively benign ruler was such that he could have established Mexico as an independent kingdom. Indeed, this is what the Council of the Indies feared. But his upbringing in a feudal world in which the king commanded absolute allegiance was against it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Later years</B>
</p>

<p>
In 1524 his restless urge to explore and conquer took him south to the jungles of Honduras. The two arduous years he spent on this disastrous expedition damaged his health and his position. His property was seized by the officials he had left in charge, and reports of the cruelty of their administration and the chaos it created aroused concern in Spain. Cort&eacute;s's fifth letter to the Spanish king attempts to justify his reckless behaviour and concludes with a bitter attack on "various and powerful rivals and enemies" who have "obscured the eyes of your Majesty." But it was his misfortune that he was not dealing simply with a king of Spain but with an emperor who ruled most of Europe and who had little time for distant colonies, except insofar as they contributed to his treasury. The Spanish bureaucrats sent out a commission of inquiry under Luis Ponce de Le&oacute;n, and, when he died almost immediately, Cort&eacute;s was accused of poisoning him and was forced to retire to his estate.
</p>

<p>
In 1528 Cort&eacute;s sailed for Spain to plead his cause in person with the king. He brought with him a great wealth of treasure and a magnificent entourage. He was received by Charles at his court at Toledo, confirmed as captain general (but not as governor), and created marqu&eacute;s del Valle. He also remarried, into a ducal family. He returned to New Spain in 1530 to find the country in a state of anarchy and so many accusations made against him&#151;even that he had murdered his first wife, Catalina, who had died that year&#151;that, after reasserting his position and reestablishing some sort of order, he retired to his estates at Cuernavaca, about 30 miles (48 km) south of Mexico City. There he concentrated on the building of his palace and on Pacific exploration.
</p>

<p>
Finally a viceroy was appointed, after which, in 1540, Cort&eacute;s returned to Spain. By then he had become thoroughly disillusioned, his life made miserable by litigation. All the rest is anticlimax. "I am old, poor and in debt . . . again and again I have begged your Majesty. . . ." In the end he was permitted to return to Mexico, but he died before he had even reached Sevilla (Seville).  (Ralph Hammond Innes, Encyclopaedia Britannica Article)
