<p class=subpagehead>Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914)
</p>

<P class=border></P>

<P>American naval officer and historian who was a highly influential exponent of sea power in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</P>

<P>Mahan was the son of a professor at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., in 1859 and went on to serve nearly 40 years of active duty in the U.S. Navy. He fought in the Civil War, later served on the staff of Admiral J.A.B. Dahlgren, and progressed steadily in rank. In 1884 he was invited by Stephen Luce, president of the newly established Naval War College at Newport, R.I., to lecture on naval history and tactics there. Mahan became the college's president in 1886 and held that post until 1889.</P>

<P>In 1890 Mahan published his college lectures as <I>The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660­1783</I>. In this book he argued for the paramount importance of sea power in national historical supremacy. The book, which came at a time of great technological improvement in warships, won immediate recognition abroad. In his second book, <I>The Influence of Sea Power upon the French Revolution and Empire, 1793­1812</I> (1892), Mahan stressed the interdependence of the military and commercial control of the sea and asserted that the control of seaborne commerce can determine the outcome of wars. Both books were avidly read in Great Britain and Germany, where they greatly influenced the buildup of naval forces in the years prior to World War I.</P>

<P>Mahan retired from the U.S. Navy in 1896 but was subsequently recalled to service. In <I>The Interest of America in Sea Power, Present and Future</I> (1897), he sought to arouse his fellow Americans to a realization of their maritime responsibilities. Mahan served as president of the American Historical Association in 1902. His other major books include <I>The Life of Nelson</I> (1897) and <I>The Major Operations of the Navies in the War of American Independence </I>(1913). Before his death in December 1914, Mahan correctly foretold the defeat of the Central Powers and of the German navy in World War I.  (Encyclopaedia Britannica Article)
