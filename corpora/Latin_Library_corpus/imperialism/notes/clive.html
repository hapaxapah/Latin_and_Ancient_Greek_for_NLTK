<p class=subpagehead>Robert Clive (1725-1744)
</p>

<p class=border></P>

<p>
Soldier and first British administrator of Bengal, who was one of the creators of British power in India. In his first governorship (1755-60) he won the Battle of Plassey and became master of Bengal. In his second governorship (1764-67) he reorganized the colony.

<p>
Young Clive was a difficult boy and was sent to several schools, including the Merchant Taylors' School in London, without much visible profit. In 1743, when 18, he was sent to Madras in the service of the English East India Company.

<p>
<b>First years in India.</B>
</p>

<p>
At Madras, Clive was moody and quarrelsome, attempted suicide, and once fought a duel. He found solace in the governor's library where he virtually educated himself. Hostilities between the English and French East India companies and their competitive support of rival Indian princes drew Clive into military service and gave him a chance to demonstrate his ability. In 1751 Chanda Sahib, an ally of the French, was besieging his British connected rival, Muhammad 'Ali, in the fortress of Trichinopoly. Clive offered to lead a diversion against Chanda's base at Arcot. With 200 Europeans and 300 Indians, he seized Arcot on August 31 and then successfully withstood a 53-day siege (September 23-November 14) by Chanda's son. This feat proved to be the turning point in a contest with the French commander, Joseph-François Dupleix. In the next months Clive established himself as a brilliant exponent of guerrilla tactics. In March 1753 he left Madras with his bride, Margaret Maskelyne, and something of a fortune, having been appointed in 1749 a commissary for the supply of provisions to the troops.

<p>
In 1755, after unsuccessfully standing for Parliament, he was sent out again to India as governor of Ft. St. David and with a lieutenant colonel's commission in the Royal Army. With him went troops intended to expel the French from India. On the way, at the request of the Bombay government, he stormed the pirate stronghold at Gheriah on the western coast.

<p>
Reaching Madras in June 1756, Clive immediately became involved in the affairs of Bengal, with which, henceforward, his fate was to be linked. Hitherto Bengal had been ruled by viceroys of the figurehead Mughal emperor, and it was under their protection that the English East India Company carried on its trade. The principal city, Calcutta, had come to rival Madras as a trading centre, and its commerce was the most valuable in India. In 1756 a dispute with the British about fortifying the city caused the new nawab (Mughal viceroy) of Bengal, Siraj-ud-Dawlah, to attack and capture the fort there.
Calcutta and Plassey.
</p>

<p>
News of the fall of Calcutta reached Madras in August 1756. After some delay Clive was given command of the relief expedition and set out on Oct. 16, 1756, with 900 Europeans and 1,500 Indians. Clive retook Calcutta on Jan. 2, 1757, and forced the Nawab to restore the company's privileges, pay compensation, and allow the British to fortify Calcutta. Determined to take advantage of discontent with the Nawab's regime, he sponsored a new ruler in order to ensure conditions agreeable to the company's trade. His candidate was Mir Ja'far, an elderly general secretly hostile to Siraj-ud-Dawlah. Clive broke with Siraj-ud-Dawlah and overthrew him at the Battle of Plassey on June 23. The conflict was more of a cannonade than a battle, and only 23 of Clive's men were killed. This victory made Clive the virtual master of Bengal.
</p>

<p>
Clive's first government lasted until February 1760. He was confirmed as governor by the company and went about the business of strengthening Mir Ja'far's authority, though at the same time keeping him under control. A challenge from the Mughal crown prince was repulsed at Patna in 1759. The Dutch, who sought to play on the Nawab's discontent at Clive's restraints, sent a force to their settlement at Chinsura, but through a series of adroit moves Clive destroyed this force even though England was at peace with the Netherlands. By 1760 Mir Ja'far's authority was unchallenged throughout Bengal and Bihar, and his subservience to the company was complete. In addition, by the dispatch of a force under Col. Francis Forde in 1758, Clive secured the Northern Sarkars from the French garrison.
</p>

<p>
His settlement of the company's affairs was less skillful. First, he accepted not only full compensation for loss to the East India Company and the Calcutta citizens but also large payments to himself and the council. He himself received in all £ 234,000 in cash, a Mughal title of nobility, and an estate, or jagir, with an annual rental of about £ 30,000. This example opened the way to a flood of corruption that nearly ruined both Bengal and the company and which Clive himself later struggled to control. Second, he obtained from the Nawab the practical exemption from internal duties not only of the company's goods but also of the private trade of the company's servants as well. Since the company possessed paramount force and its servants believed in working on their own behalf, this had a most harmful effect on the economy of Bengal.
</p>

<p>
Though stained by corruption and duplicity, Clive's first government was a tour de force of generalship and statecraft. He had snatched the richest province of India out of the hands of his political superiors and with the authority of the Mughal regime. Returning to England in February 1760, he was given an Irish peerage as Baron Clive of Plassey in 1762 and was knighted in 1764. He was described by William Pitt (afterward 1st earl of Chatham) as "a heaven-born general." He became member of Parliament for Shrewsbury, purchased an estate, and tried to use his Indian wealth to carve out an English political career. But he had to reckon with the current jealousy toward any upstart, however brilliant, the unpopularity of returned Indian "nabobs," and suspicions within the East India Company resulting from his suggestion to Pitt that the state should take over its territories. His critics, led by a former friend who was then chairman of the company, tried to cut off the income from his Indian estates. Though they failed to ruin him, they did prevent him from becoming a national statesman.
</p>

<p>
In 1764 opinion within the company turned in Clive's favour because of the news from India. Clive's protégé Mir Ja'far had been deposed in favour of Mir Qasim, who in turn had been deposed in 1763. Shah 'Alam II, the Mughal emperor, attacked again, and the company seemed to be on the brink of disaster. Clive was appointed governor and commander in chief of Bengal with power to override the council. Arriving in Calcutta for the second time on May 3, 1765, he found that the decisive Battle of Baksar (Buxar) had already been won; Shuja'-ud-Dawlah, the nawab of Oudh, was in flight, and the Emperor had joined the British camp. But there was a political and military vacuum between Bengal and Delhi (the Mughal capital), and the whole Bengal administration was in confusion.
</p>

<p>
<b>Clive's administrative achievements.</B>
</p>

<p>
Clive's chief claim to fame as a statesman rests upon the achievements of his second governorship. His work falls into three parts: external policy, the settlement of Bengal, and the reform of the company's service. In his external policy Clive had to face one of the most difficult tests of statesmanship: that of knowing where to stop. Though there was nothing to prevent him from restoring Shah 'Alam II to Delhi and ruling north India in his name, he wisely decided to limit the company's commitments to Bengal and Bihar. Oudh was returned to Shuja'-ud-Dawlah a buffer state between Bengal and the turbulent northwest. The Emperor was solaced with an annual tribute, and in return he conferred the revenue administration (dewanee) of Bengal on the East India Company. This grant formed the key to Clive's second achievement, the settlement of Bengal. It gave legal authority to the company to collect the revenues of Bengal and Bihar, sending the Emperor only his annual tribute. The administration of the dewanee was organized through a deputy nawab appointed by the company. The police and magisterial power was still exercised by the nawab of Bengal as the Emperor's deputy, but he in turn nominated the company's deputy to act for him. This was Clive's so-called dual system, which made the company the virtual ruler of India's two richest provinces.
</p>

<p>
Clive's third task was the reform of the company's service. Within two days of landing he superseded the Calcutta council, which defied his predecessor, Henry Vansittart. He reestablished discipline by accepting all resignations, enforcing others, and bringing replacements from Madras. All company servants were required to sign covenants not to receive presents worth more than 1,000 rupees without the consent of the governor. Private trade, the abuse of which had caused the war, was forbidden. This was the least successful measure because the company's officials were not adequately paid and had no other means of livelihood. Clive tried to meet the difficulty by forming a trading company that administered the salt monopoly and in which the servants received shares according to their rank. These two measures, only partially successful, marked the end of nearly 10 years' reckless plunder in Bengal. Finally Clive dealt with the army with equal rigour. He cut down swollen allowances and faced with dauntless courage the White Mutiny of discontented officers, when for a time he stood almost alone in Bengal.
</p>

<p>
Clive left Calcutta in January 1767. His second government was his crowning achievement, but he had made many enemies. An active group, supported by Lord Chatham, feared the corrupting influence of Indian wealth on English public life. In 1772, when the company appealed to the government to save it from bankruptcy, it appeared that Clive's system of government in Bengal had not been as successful as had been hoped. Two parliamentary committees uncovered the facts of corruption among the company's servants, and this set off an attack on Clive as the instigator of the whole process. He defended himself in Parliament (1773) with characteristic vigour and conviction, complaining of being treated like a sheep stealer and declaring "I stand astonished at my own moderation." In 1773 Parliament declared that he did "render great and meritorious services to his country." This triumph was his last. With his already shaken health, the strain on his melancholic temperament was too great: November 1774 he died by his own hand at his house in London. Clive's talents were outstanding, his character no more unscrupulous than that of many men of his day, and his work marked the real beginning of the British Empire in India. (T.G.
