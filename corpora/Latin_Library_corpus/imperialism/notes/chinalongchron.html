</P>

<p>
<i>1814</i> -  First recorded Chinese convert to Western Christianity (the Nestorian form was long-established in China).
</P>

<p>
<i>1816</i> -  The British East India Company decides to develop imports of opium into China.
</P>

<p>
<i>1839-1842</i> -  <B>The First Opium War.</B> Early in the 19th century, British merchants began smuggling opium into China in order to balance their purchases of tea for export to Britain. In 1839 the Qing government, after a decade of unsuccessful anti-opium campaigns, adopted drastic prohibitory laws against the opium trade. The emperor dispatched a commissioner, Lin Zexu (1785-1850), to Guangzhou (Canton) to suppress illicit opium traffic. Lin seized illegal stocks of opium owned by Chinese dealers and then detained the entire foreign community and confiscated and destroyed some 20,000 chests of illicit British opium.  Great Britain, which had been looking to end China's restrictions on foreign trade, responded by sending gunboats to attack several Chinese coastal cities.  Unprepared for war and grossly underestimating the capabilities of the enemy, the Chinese were disastrously defeated, and their image of their own imperial power was tarnished beyond repair.
</p>

<p>
<i>1842</i> -  The First Opium War ends. China, unable to withstand modern arms, was defeated and forced to sign the Treaty of Nanjing (1842) and the British Supplementary Treaty of the Bogue (1843).  These provided that the ports of Guangzhou, Jinmen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and Shanghai should be open to British trade and residence; in addition Hong Kong was ceded to the British. Within a few years other Western powers signed similar treaties with China and received commercial and residential privileges, and the Western domination of China's treaty ports began.
</p>

<p>
<i>1845</i> -  The Sino-American Treaty of Wangxia permits Americans to trade in the treaty ports and to purchase land for Protestant churches and missions. It also establishes the principle of extraterritoriality by which foreigners are tried only by their own consuls.
</p>

<p>
<i>1850-64</i> -  <B>Taiping Rebellion.</B> The peasants, having suffered floods and famines in the late 1840s, were ripe for rebellion, which came under the leadership of Hong Xiuquan. Hong's visions convinced him he was the younger brother of Jesus, and he saw it as his duty to free China from Manchu rule. Taiping rebels captured Nanjing in 1853. Their attempts to capture Beijing failed, but an expedition into the upper Yangtze River valley scored many victories. Hong's idiosyncratic Christianity alienated both Western missionaries and the Chinese scholar-gentry. Without the gentry, the Taiping forces were unable to govern the countryside or supply their cities effectively. The leadership strayed from its original austerity and descended into power struggles that left Hong without competent help. In 1860 an attempt to take Shanghai was repelled by U.S.- and British-led forces, and by 1862 Chinese forces under Zeng Guofan had surrounded Nanjing.  Sporadic resistance continued elsewhere until 1868. The rebellion ravaged 17 provinces, took some 20 million lives, and left the Qing government unable to regain an effective hold over the country.
</p>

<p>
<i>1856-1860</i> -  <B>The Second Opium War.</B> War broke out following an allegedly illegal Chinese search of a British-registered ship, the <i>Arrow</i>, in Guangzhou. British and French troops took Guangzhou and Tianjin and compelled the Chinese to accept the treaties of Tianjin (1858), to which France, Russia, and the United States were also party.
</P>

<p>
<i>1857</i> -  British and French troops occupy Canton.
</P>

<p>
<i>1858</i> -  <B>The Treaty of Tianjin (Tientsin).</B> China agreed to open 11 more ports, permit foreign legations in Beijing, sanction Christian missionary activity, and legalize the import of opium.
</P>

<p>
<i>1859</i> -  China's  attempt to block the entry of diplomats into Beijing as well as Britain's determination to enforce the new treaty terms led to a renewal of the Second Opium War.
</P>

<p>
<i>1860</i> -  An Anglo-French force occupies Beijing and destroys the Imperial Summer Palace. The Beijing conventions of 1860, by which China was forced to reaffirm the terms of the Treaty of Tianjin and make additional concessions, concluded the hostilities.
</p>

<p>
<i>1860s-90s</i> -  The opening of a Foreign Office in Beijing in 1861 marks the beginning of a number of diplomatic and military modernization projects described collectively as the Self-Strengthening movement.
</p>

<P>
<i>1872</i> -  First Chinese students go abroad.
</P>

<P>
<i>1876</i> -  The Convention of Chih-fu (1876) opened four more treaty ports.
</P>

<p>
<i>1881-1885</i> -  <B>Franco-Chinese War.</B>  China  gave up its sovereignty over Annam and Tonkin (now in north Vietnam). These territories were later included in French Indochina.
</p>

<p>
<i>1894-1895</i> -  <B>Sino-Japanese War.</B> China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War exposes the limitations of the Self-Strengthening movement. The Treaty of Shimonoseki forced China to cede Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to Japan, pay a huge indemnity, permit the establishment of Japanese industries in four treaty ports, and recognize Japanese hegemony over Korea. Young radicals, among them Sun Yat-sen, form Self-Strengthening and Revive China societies.
</p>

<P>
<i>1897</i> -  Russians occupy Dairen; Germany annexes the Ching-tao area in Shantung.
</P>

<p>
<i>1898</i> -  The British acquired a ninety-nine-year lease over the so-called <I>New Territories of Kowloon</I>, which increased the size of their Hong Kong colony. Britain, Japan, Russia, Germany, France, and Belgium each gained spheres of influence in China. China is forced to grant a 25-year lease on Lushun (Port Arthur) and the Dalian (Dairen) peninsula. Germany acquires Jiaozhou (Kiaochow) Bay. France demands a lease on Guangzhou (Kwangchow) Bay and Britain obtains a lease on Weihaiwei for as long as the Russians remain in Lushun and on Hong Kong's New Territories for 99 years.
</p>

<p>
<i>1898</i> - <B>The Hundred Days Reform.</B>  In the 103 days from June 11 to September 21, 1898, the Qing emperor, Guangxu (1875-1908), ordered a series of reforms aimed at making sweeping social and institutional changes. Opposition to the reform was intense among the conservative ruling elite, especially the Manchus, who, in condemning the announced reform as too radical, proposed instead a more moderate and gradualist course of change. Supported by ultra-conservatives and with the tacit support of the political opportunist Yuan Shikai (1859-1916), Empress Dowager Cixi engineered a <I>coup d'etat</I> on September 21, 1898, forcing the young reform-minded Guangxu into seclusion. Cixi took over the government as regent. The Hundred Days' Reform ended with the rescindment of the new edicts and the execution of six of the reform's chief advocates. The conservatives then gave clandestine backing to the anti-foreign and anti-Christian movement of secret societies known as Yihetuan (Society of Righteousness and Harmony). The movement has been better known in the West as the Boxers.
</p>

<p>
<i>1898-1900</i> -  <B>The Boxer Rebellion.</B> An antiforeign movement in China, culminating in a desperate uprising against Westerners and Western influence, leads to the siege of the legations in Beijing. In June, 1900, the Boxers (some 140,000 strong and now led by the war party at court), occupied Beijing and for eight weeks besieged the foreigners and the Chinese Christians there. Provincial governors in southeast China suppressed the court's declaration of war and assured the powers of protection for foreign interests, thus limiting the area of conflict to north China. The siege was lifted in August by an international force of British, French, Russian, American, German, and Japanese troops, which had fought its way through from Tianjin.
</P>

<p>
<i>1899</i> -  <B>The Open Door Policy.</B> The United States, which had not acquired any territorial cessions, proposed in 1899 that there be an "open door" policy in China, whereby all foreign countries would have equal duties and privileges in all treaty ports within and outside the various spheres of influence. All the Powers except Russia agreed to the United States overture. Despite the agreement, China continued to be divided into separate zones of influence.
</P>

<p>
<i>1901</i> -  By the Boxer Protocol China is required to pay an indemnity of $333 million to the Western powers, to amend commercial treaties to the advantage of the foreign nations, and to permit the stationing of foreign troops in Beijing. 
</p>

<p>
<i>1905</i> -  Civil service examinations are abolished. In Tokyo Sun Yat-sen forms the Alliance Society, precursor of the Kuomintang or Nationalist Party.
</p>

<p>
<i>1908</i> -  The Empress Dowager dies and the 2-year-old Puyi is proclaimed emperor. China holds the first elections for regional assemblies the following year.
</P>

<p>
<i>1910</i> -  Division of north-eastern China into Russian and Japanese spheres of influence.
</P>

<p>
<i>1911</i> -  The republican revolution broke out on October 10, 1911, in Wuchang, the capital of Hubei Province, among discontented modernized army units whose anti-Qing plot had been uncovered. It had been preceded by numerous abortive uprisings and organized protests inside China. The revolt quickly spread to neighboring cities. By late November, fifteen of the twenty-four provinces had declared their independence of the Qing empire. A month later, Sun Yat-sen returned to China from the United States, where he had been raising funds among overseas Chinese and American sympathizers.
