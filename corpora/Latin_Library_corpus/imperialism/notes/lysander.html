<p class=subpagehead>Lysander (d. 395 B.C.)
</p>

<P class=border></P>
<P>Greek military and political leader who won the final victory for Sparta in the Peloponnesian War and, at its close, wielded great power throughout Greece.</P>

<P>
Nothing is known of his early career. In his first year as admiral he won a sea battle off Notium (406) and obtained support of the Persian viceroy, Cyrus the Younger. Because Spartan law forbade a second term, Lysander nominally was second in command, though the actual Spartan leader, in the destruction of the Athenian fleet in the Battle of Aegospotami (q.v.), September 405 BC; this action closed the grain route through the Hellespont, thereby starving Athens into surrender (April 404). 
</p>
<P>
Lysander instigated establishment of the oligarchy of the Thirty Tyrants in Athens, and many of Athens' former allies came to be ruled by boards of 10 (decarchy) of his partisans, often reinforced with garrisons under a Spartan commander (harmost). In 403 Lysander was sent to support the Thirty at Athens against Thrasybulus' democratic revolt. He was nearly successful, but a reversal of policy in Sparta led to a settlement that allowed the restoration of democracy at Athens. This was a defeat for Lysander; his decarchies probably were abolished and most likely he suffered a political eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
He helped Agesilaus II succeed to the throne of Sparta in 399 but subsequently was rejected by the monarch. 
</p>
<P>At the outbreak of the Corinthian War (395-387), Lysander led an army of Sparta's northern allies into Boeotia and was killed while attacking Haliartus. (Encyclopaedia Britannica Article)</P>
