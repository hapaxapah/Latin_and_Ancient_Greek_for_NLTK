Herodutus: The Origins of the Persian War
</p>

<P class=border></P>

<p>
These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, which he  publishes, in the hope of thereby preserving from decay the remembrance  of what men have done, and of preventing the great and wonderful actions  of the Greeks and the Barbarians from losing their due meed of glory; and  withal to put on record what were their grounds of feuds.
</P>
<p>
1. According to  the Persians best informed in history, the Phoenicians began the quarrel.  This people, who had formerly dwelt on the shores of the Erythraean Sea,  having migrated to the Mediterranean and settled in the parts which they  now inhabit, began at once, they say, to adventure on long voyages, freighting  their vessels with the wares of Egypt and Assyria. They landed at many  places on the coast, and among the rest at Argos, which was then preeminent  above all the states included now under the common name of Hellas. Here  they exposed their merchandise, and traded with the natives for five or  six days; at the end of which time, when almost everything was sold, there  came down to the beach a number of women, and among them the daughter of  the king, who was, they say, agreeing in this with the Greeks, Io, the  child of Inachus. The women were standing by the stern of the ship intent  upon their purchases, when the Phoenicians, with a general shout, rushed  upon them. The greater part made their escape, but some were seized and  carried off. Io herself was among the captives. The Phoenicians put the  women on board their vessel, and set sail for Egypt. Thus did Io pass into  Egypt, according to the Persian story, which differs widely from the Phoenician:  and thus commenced, according to their authors, the series of outrages.

2. At a later period, certain Greeks, with whose name they are unacquainted,  but who would probably be Cretans, made a landing at Tyre, on the Phoenician  coast, and bore off the king's daughter, Europe. In this they only retaliated;  but afterwards the Greeks, they say, were guilty of a second violence.  They manned a ship of war, and sailed to Aea, a city of Colchis, on the river Phasis; from whence, after despatching the rest of the business on  which they had come, they carried off Medea, the daughter of the king of  the land. The monarch sent a herald into Greece to demand reparation of  the wrong, and the restitution of his child; but the Greeks made answer  that, having received no reparation of the wrong done them in the seizure  of Io the Argive, they should give none in this instance.

3. In the next generation afterwards, according to the same authorities,  Alexander the son of Priam, bearing these events in mind, resolved to procure  himself a wife out of Greece by violence, fully persuaded, that as the  Greeks had not given satisfaction for their outrages, so neither would  he be forced to make any for his. Accordingly he made prize of Helen; upon  which the Greeks decided that, before resorting to other measures, they  would send envoys to reclaim the princess and require reparation of the  wrong. Their demands were met by a reference to the violence which had  been offered to Medea, and they were asked with what face they could now  require satisfaction, when they had formerly rejected all demands for either  reparation or restitution addressed to them.

<p>
4. Hitherto the injuries on either side had been mere acts of common  violence; but in what followed the Persians consider that the Greeks were  greatly to blame, since before any attack had been made on Europe, they  led an army into Asia. Now as for the carrying off of women, it is the  deed, they say, of a rogue: but to make a stir about such as are carried  off, argues a man a fool. Men of sense care nothing for such women, since  it is plain that without their own consent they would never be forced away.  The Asiatics, when the Greeks ran off with their women, never troubled  themselves about the matter; but the Greeks, for the sake of a single Lacedaemonian  girl, collected a vast armament, invaded Asia, and destroyed the kingdom  of Priam. Henceforth they ever looked upon the Greeks as their open enemies.  For Asia, with all the various tribes of barbarians that inhabit it, is  regarded by the Persians as their own; but Europe and the Greek race they  look on as distinct and separate.

5. Such is the account which the Persians give of these matters. They  trace to the attack upon Troy their ancient enmity towards the Greeks.  The Phoenicians, however, as regards Io, vary from the Persian statements.  They deny that they used any violence to remove her into Egypt; she herself,  they say, having formed an intimacy with the captain, while his vessel  lay at Argos, and perceiving herself to be with child, of her own free  will accompanied the Phoenicians on their leaving the shore, to escape  the shame of detection and the reproaches of her parents. Whether this  latter account be true, or whether the matter happened otherwise, I shall  not discuss further. I shall proceed at once to point out the person who  first within my own knowledge inflicted injury on the Greeks, after which  I shall go forward with my history, describing equally the greater and  the lesser cities. For the cities which were formerly great have most of  them become insignificant; and such as are at present powerful, were weak  in the olden time. I shall therefore discourse equally of both, convinced  that human happiness never continues long in one stay.
