Rudyard Kipling: The White Man's Burden (1899)
</p>

<P class=border></P>

<p>
Take up the White Man's burden&#151;<BR>
Send forth the best ye breed&#151;<BR>
Go bind your sons to exile<BR>
To serve your captives' need;<BR>
To wait in heavy harness,<BR>
On fluttered folk and wild&#151;<BR>
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,<BR>
Half-devil and half-child.<BR>
<BR>
Take up the White Man's burden&#151;<BR>
In patience to abide,<BR>
To veil the threat of terror<BR>
And check the show of pride;<BR>
By open speech and simple,<BR>
An hundred times made plain<BR>
To seek another's profit,<BR>
And work another's gain.<BR>
<BR>
Take up the White Man's burden&#151;<BR>
The savage wars of peace&#151;<BR>
Fill full the mouth of Famine<BR>
And bid the sickness cease;<BR>
And when your goal is nearest<BR>
The end for others sought,<BR>
Watch sloth and heathen Folly<BR>
Bring all your hopes to nought.<BR>
<BR>
Take up the White Man's burden&#151;<BR>
No tawdry rule of kings,<BR>
But toil of serf and sweeper&#151;<BR>
The tale of common things.<BR>
The ports ye shall not enter,<BR>
The roads ye shall not tread,<BR>
Go mark them with your living,<BR>
And mark them with your dead.<BR>
<BR>
Take up the White Man's burden&#151;<BR>
And reap his old reward:<BR>
The blame of those ye better,<BR>
The hate of those ye guard&#151;<BR>
The cry of hosts ye humour<BR>
(Ah, slowly!) toward the light:&#151;<BR>
"Why brought he us from bondage,<BR>
Our loved Egyptian night?"<BR>
<BR>
Take up the White Man's burden&#151;<BR>
Ye dare not stoop to less&#151;<BR>
Nor call too loud on Freedom<BR>
To cloke your weariness;<BR>
By all ye cry or whisper,<BR>
By all ye leave or do,<BR>
The silent, sullen peoples<BR>
Shall weigh your gods and you.<BR>
<BR>
Take up the White Man's burden&#151;<BR>
Have done with childish days&#151;<BR>
The lightly proferred laurel,<BR>
The easy, ungrudged praise.<BR>
Comes now, to search your manhood<BR>
Through all the thankless years<BR>
Cold, edged with dear-bought wisdom,<BR>
The judgment of your peers!
