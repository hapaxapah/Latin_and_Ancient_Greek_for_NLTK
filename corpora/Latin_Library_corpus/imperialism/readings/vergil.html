Vergil: Selections from <i>The Aeneid</I> (19 B.C.)
</p>

<p class=border></P>

<p>
<b>Vergil's Introduction:</B>
</p>

<p>
Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate,<br>
And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,<br>
Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore.<br>
Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore,<br>
And in the doubtful war, before he won<br>
The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town;<br>
His banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine,<br>
And settled sure succession in his line,<br>
From whence the race of Alban fathers come,<br>
And the long glories of majestic Rome.
</p>

<p>
<b>Jupiter's Prophecy</B>
</p>

<p>
Three full centuries<br>
That kingdom [of Alba Longa] will be ruled by Hector's race,<br>
Until the queen and priestess, Ilia,<br>
Pregnant by Mars, will bear twin sons to him.<br>
Afterward, happy in the tawny pelt<br>
His nurse, the she-wolf, wears, young Romulus<br>
Will take the leadership, build walls of Mars,<br>
And call by his own name his people Romans.<br>
For these I set no limits, world or time,<br>
But make a gift of empire without end.<br>
Juno, indeed, whose bitterness now fills<br>
With fear and torment the sea and earth and sky,<br>
Will mend her ways, and favor them as I do,<br>
Lords of the world, the toga-bearing Romans.
</p>

<p>
<b>Prophey of Anchises</B>
</p>

<p>
Others will cast more tenderly in bronze<br>
Their breathing figures, I can well believe,<br>
And bring more lifelike portraits out of marble ;<br>
Argue more eloquently, use the pointer<br>
To trace the paths of heaven accurately<br>
And accurately foretell the rising stars.<br>
Roman, remember by your strength to rule<br>
Earth's peoples&#151;for your arts are to be these :<br>
To pacify, impose the rule of law,<br>
To spare the conquered, battle down the proud.
