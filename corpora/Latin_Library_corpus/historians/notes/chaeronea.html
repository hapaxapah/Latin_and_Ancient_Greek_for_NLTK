<p class=subpagehead>Chaeronea
</p>

<P class=border></P>

<P>A town in Boeotia, on the Cephissus, near the frontier of Phocis, memorable for the defeat of the Athenians and the Boeotians by Philip of Macedon, which crushed the liberties of Greece, B.C. 338, and for Sulla 's victory over the army of Mithridates, B.C. 86. Chaeronea was the birthplace of Plutarch. Several remains of the ancient city are to be seen at Capraena, more particularly a theatre excavated in the rock, an aqueduct, and the marble lion (broken in pieces) which adorned the sepulchre of the Boeotians who fell at the battle of Chaeronea.  (<I>Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities</I>, 1898)
