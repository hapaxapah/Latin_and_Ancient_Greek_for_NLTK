<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>The most distinguished Spartan in the first part of the <A HREF="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/thucydnotes/pelopwar.html">Peloponnesian War</A>. In B.C. 424, at the head of a small force, having effected a dexterous march through the hostile country of <A HREF="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/thucydnotes/thessaly.html">Thessaly</A>, he gained possession of many of the cities in Macedonia that were subject to Athens; his greatest acquisition was <A HREF="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/thucydnotes/amphipolis.html">Amphipolis.</A>
<P>
 In 422, with only a handful of helots and mercenary troops, he gained a brilliant victory over <A HREF="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/thucydnotes/cleon.html">Cleon</A>, who had been sent with a powerful Athenian force to recover Amphipolis. Brasidas was slain in the battle. He was buried within the city, and the inhabitants honoured him as a hero by yearly sacrifices and by games.
<P>
Thucydides praises alike the eloquence and the liberality and wisdom of Brasidas, and Plato compares him to Achilles.  (Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, 1898)
