<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>A town in Macedonia, on the narrow isthmus of the peninsula Pallené, was a colony of the Corinthians. It afterwards became tributary to Athens, and its revolt from the latter city, in B.C. 432, was one of the immediate causes of the <A HREF="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/thucydnotes/pelopwar.html">Peloponnesian War</A> (q.v.). It was taken by the Athenians in 429, after a siege of more than two years, its inhabitants expelled, and their place supplied by Athenian colonists.
<P>
In 356 it was taken by Philip, who destroyed the city and gave its territory to the Olynthians. Cassander built a new city on the same site, to which he gave the name of Cassandrea, and which soon became the most flourishing city in all Macedonia.   (Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, 1898)
