This directory contains three bash scripts to be used with the Perseus Classics folder. They are very simple: each recursively searches the Classics directory and copies XML files into a single new directory.

    (1) all_xml_to_new_directory.sh
    This script finds all XML files (Latin and Greek) within 
    Classics and copies them into a directory called 
    "Perseus_classics_xml".
    
    (2) all_latin_xml_to_new_directory.sh
    This script finds all Latin XML files within 
    Classics and copies them into a directory called 
    "Perseus_Latin_xml".

    (2) all_greek_xml_to_new_directory.sh
    This script finds all Greek XML files within 
    Classics and copies them into a directory called 
    "Perseus_Greek_xml".

To find the Classics directory, untar the archive "20110527-hopper-texts-GreekRoman.tar.gz", found within the /data/ folder of this project.
