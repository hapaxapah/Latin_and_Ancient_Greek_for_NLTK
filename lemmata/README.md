This directory contains a working program ("lemmata_replacements.py") which is to lemmatize raw Latin text. For a working example, run:
        python example.py
which will turn all inflected forms into their lexical headword (e.g., "amicitiam" becomes "amicitia").

The replacement list has been migrated from the Perseus Project's source code; it has has *not* yet been tested for either (a) its original lemmatatological accuracy, or (b) any errors that I could have introduced into the list in my migrations (not likely but possible).
