Here are English-language stemmers taken from "/nltk/nltk/stem". They're English examples.

Some notes:

(a) snowball.py as a dictionary lookup format for "__special_words"

(b) porter.py allows for unique dictionary list. Below taken from:

Exceptional forms in general

It is quite easy to expand a Snowball script so that certain exceptional word forms get special treatment. The standard case is that certain words W1,  W2  ..., instead of passing through the stemming process, are mapped to the forms  X1,  X2  ... respectively. If the script does the stemming by means of the call 
    define stem as C
where  C  is a command, the exceptional cases can be dealt with by extending this to 
    define stem as ( exception or C )
and putting in a routine  exception: 
    define exception as (
        [substring] atlimit among(
            'W1'  ( <- 'X1' )
            'W2'  ( <- 'X2' )
            ...
        )
    )
atlimit  causes the whole string to be tested for equality with one of the  Wi, and if a match is found, the string is replaced with Xi. 

More precisely we might have a group of words  W11,  W12  ... that need to be mapped to  X1, another group  W21,  W22 ... that need to be mapped to  X2, and so on, and a list of words V1,  V2  ...  Vk  that are to remain invariant. The exception  routine may then be written as follows: 
    among( 'W11' 'W12' ... (<- 'X1')
           'W21' 'W22' ... (<- 'X2')
           ...
           'Wn1' 'Wn2' ... (<- 'Xn')
           'V1' 'V2' ... 'Vk'
         )
And indeed the  exception1  routine for the English stemmer has just that shape: 
    define exception1 as (

         [substring] atlimit among(

            /* special changes: */

            'skis'      (<-'ski')
            'skies'     (<-'sky')
            'dying'     (<-'die')
            'lying'     (<-'lie')
            'tying'     (<-'tie')

            /* special -LY cases */

            'idly'      (<-'idl')
            'gently'    (<-'gentl')
            'ugly'      (<-'ugli')
            'early'     (<-'earli')
            'only'      (<-'onli')
            'singly'    (<-'singl')

            // ... extensions possible here ...

            /* invariant forms: */

            'sky'
            'news'
            'howe'

            'atlas' 'cosmos' 'bias' 'andes' // not plural forms

            // ... extensions possible here ...
        )
    )
(More will be said about the words that appear here shortly.) 

Here we see words being treated exceptionally before stemming is done, but equally we could treat stems exceptionally after stemming is done, and so, if we wish, map absorpt to absorb, reduct to reduc etc., as in the Lovins stemmer. But more generally, throughout the algorithm, each significant step may have recognised exceptions, and a suitably placed  among  will take care of them. For example, a point made at least twice in the literature is that words beginning gener are overstemmed by the Porter stemmer:
generate
generates
generated
generating
general
generally
generic
generically
generous
generously		   ->  		gener
To fix this over-stemming, we make an exception to the usual setting of p1, the left point of R1, and therefore replace 
    gopast v  gopast non-v  setmark p1
with 
    among (
        'gener'
        // ... and other stems may be included here ...
    ) or (gopast v  gopast non-v)
    setmark p1
after which the words beginning gener stem as follows:
generate
generates
generated
generating		   ->  		generat
general
generally		   ->  		general
generic
generically		   ->  		generic
generous
generously		   ->  		generous
Another example is given by the  exception2  routine, which is similar to  exception1, but placed after the call of  Step_1a, which may have removed terminal s, 
    define exception2 as (

        [substring] atlimit among(
            'inning' 'outing' 'canning' 'herring'
            'proceed' 'exceed' 'succeed'

            // ... extensions possible here ...

        )
    )

Snowball makes it easy therefore to add in lists of exceptions. But deciding what the lists of exceptions should be is far from easy. Essentially there are two lines of attack, the systematic and the piecemeal. One might systematically treat as exceptions the stem changes of irregular verbs, for example. The piecemeal approach is to add in exceptions as people notice them — like gener above. The problem with the systematic approach is that it should be done by investigating the entire language vocabulary, and that is more than most people are prepared to do. The problem with the piecemeal approach is that it is arbitrary, and usually yields little. 

The exception lists in the English stemmer are meant to be illustrative (‘this is how it is done if you want to do it’), and were derived piecemeal. 

a) The new stemmer improves on the Porter stemmer in handling short words ending e and y. There is however a mishandling of the four forms sky, skies, ski, skis, which is easily corrected by treating three of these words as special cases. 

b) Similarly there is a problem with the ing form of three letter verbs ending ie. There are only three such verbs: die, lie and tie, so a special case is made for dying, lying and tying. 

c) One has to be a little careful of certain ing forms. inning, outing, canning, which one does not wish to be stemmed to in, out, can. 

d) The removal of suffix ly, which is not in the Porter stemmer, has a number of exceptions. Certain short-word exceptions are idly, gently, ugly, early, only, singly. Rarer words (bristly, burly, curly, surly ...) are not included. 

e) The remaining words were included following complaints from users of the Porter algorithm. news is not the plural of new (noticed when IR systems were being set up for Reuters). Howe is a surname, and needs to be separated from how (noticed when doing a search for ‘Sir Geoffrey Howe’ in a demonstration at the House of Commons). succeed etc are not past participles, so the ed should not be removed (pointed out to me in an email from India). herring should not stem to her (another email from Russia). 

f) Finally, a few non-plural words ending s have been added. 

Incidentally, this illustrates how much feedback to expect from the real users of a stemming algorithm: seven or eight words in twenty years! 

The definition of the English stemmer above is therefore supplemented by the following: 


 
Exceptional forms in the English stemmer

If the words begins gener, commun or arsen, set R1 to be the remainder of the word. 

Stem certain special words as follows, 

skis		   ->  		ski
skies		   ->  		sky
dying 
lying 
tying		->		die 
lie 
tie
idly 
gently 
ugly 
early 
only 
singly		->		idl 
gentl 
ugli 
earli 
onli 
singl


If one of the following is found, leave it invariant, 

sky 
news 
howe
atlas  		   cosmos  		   bias  		   andes


Following step 1a, leave the following invariant, 

inning  		   outing  		   canning  		   herring  		   earring
proceed  		   exceed  		   succeed
